                            From front-end to back-end, my expertise knows no limits. Once a computer engineer
                            major, I founded out about coding, and thus submerged myself in the world of programming.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Graduating from Prince George&#39;s Community College, I have learned to
                            design algorithms to solve complex mathematical or scientific problems
                            and utilize object-oriented methodology to write efficient code. Onwards,
                            I&#39;ve graduated from General Assembly&#39;s Software Immersive Bootcamp which consisted of
                            420+ hours of learning the fundamentals of front-end and back-end web development.
                            I am now pursuing on obtaining my Bachelor&#39;s degree at University Of Maryland.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            As a result of these experiences, I had the opportunity to work with a
                            variety of developers and teams. This has allowed me to develop a working style that emphasizes{" "}

                            <span className="font-bold">{" problem-solving"}</span>,

                            Alongside that, my background in management allows
                            me to improve my communication and leadership skills to make me an efficient team player.
