              From front-end to back-end, my expertise knows no limits. Once a
              computer engineer major, I founded out about coding, and thus
              submerged myself in the world of programming.

              As a graduate of both Prince George's Community College and
              University of Maryland, I have learned to design algorithms to
              solve complex mathematical or scientific problems and utilize
              object-oriented methodology to write efficient code. Onwards,
              I&#39;ve graduated from General Assembly&#39;s Software Immersive
              Bootcamp which consisted of 420+ hours of learning the
              fundamentals of front-end and back-end web development. I've also
              interned as a Full-stack developer to help develop{" "}

              As a result of these experiences, I had the opportunity to work
              with a variety of developers and teams. This has allowed me to
